<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to Twilio Console">
    Sign in to the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/).
  </Step>

<Step title="Create SIP Trunk">
  Navigate to **Elastic SIP Trunking** → **Manage** → **Trunks**. Select
  **Create new SIP Trunk**, provide a friendly name (e.g., "SuperU Outbound"),
  and click **Create SIP Trunk**.
</Step>

  <Step title="Configure Termination">
    Select **Termination** in the left sidebar of your trunk settings.

    1.  **Termination SIP URI**: Choose a unique SIP URI (e.g., `my-superu-trunk.pstn.twilio.com`) and copy it. You will need this for the SuperU dashboard.
    2.  **IP Access Control Lists**: You can skip this for credential-based authentication.
    3.  **Credential Lists**: Click the **+** icon to create a new Credential List.

  </Step>

<Step title="Configure Authentication">
  In the **Create Credential List** modal: 1. Provide a friendly name for the
  list. 2. Enter a **Username** and **Password**.
  <Note>
    Make sure these values match the username and password you use for your
    SuperU outbound trunk.
  </Note>
  Click **Create** to save the credentials. Then make sure the checkbox for your
  new list is selected on the Termination page. Click **Save** at the bottom of
  the Termination page.
</Step>

  <Step title="Connect to SuperU">
    Go to your SuperU dashboard and open the **Bring Your Own Number** modal.

    Fill in the details using the information from your Twilio trunk:

    *   **Phone Number**: Enter the phone number you purchased in Twilio (ensure it is associated with this trunk if required, though typically for outbound only trunk association logic varies, usually just needs to be a verified caller ID or number on the account).
    *   **Destination**: Select the appropriate region.

        *   Zurich
        *   Saudi Arabia
        *   Australia
    *   **Termination URI**: Paste the **Termination SIP URI** you created (e.g., `my-superu-trunk.pstn.twilio.com`).
    *   **SIP Username**: Enter the username you created in the **Credential List**.
    *   **SIP Password**: Enter the password you created in the **Credential List**.
