# How to Buy a Phone Number

Phone numbers are how your superU Voice AI agents connect with real people. Once you buy a number, you can attach it to any agent for inbound or outbound campaigns.

### Why You Need a Number

Every live call made through superU AI runs through a verified phone number. Buying your own number ensures your calls look professional, helps track campaigns, and allows inbound calls to reach your agent directly. You can choose local or international numbers depending on where your customers are.

## Step 1: Login and Buy a Number

Log in to your superU workspace and go to the **Phone Numbers** tab from the left menu.

Pick the area that matches your customer base. We offer phone numbers of major countries. For example, if you serve clients in the US, choose a US number for a US-based caller ID.

## Step 2: Review and Confirm

Once you select a number, review the details and click **Buy Number**. The number will be added to your workspace instantly.

You'll now see your purchased number listed under **Phone Numbers** with its status set to **Active**.
