Go to the [superU Dashboard.](https://workspace.superu.ai/dashboard) and sign up to your workspace.

Choose how you want to build your agent. You can start from scratch, let AI create one from your brief, or pick a ready-made template to get started quickly.

## Start from Scratch

If you choose to start from a blank agent, you'll begin by setting up the basics: pick a voice, language, and model, then describe what your agent should do. You'll also add the system prompt to define its personality and write the first message it'll say on a call.

Browse the **Voice Library** from the sidebar, filter by provider, gender, or language, and play a few samples to find one that matches your agent's tone and personality. Keep your preferred voice in mind for later since you can change it anytime from your agent settings.

## Test Your Agent

Once your agent is created and published, you can now test how it performs in real time.

Click **"Test AI Agent"** at the top right of your screen. A test window will open where you can choose between **Web Call** (browser-based) or **Phone Call**.

Plug in your **headphones or mic** for a smoother experience and click **"Initiate Call"** to start testing.

Speak naturally or type your questions to check how the agent greets, responds, and follows the script.

If you spot any issues, make quick adjustments in the **System Prompt**, **First Message**, or **Knowledge Base**, then test again. Once your agent sounds polished and natural, you're ready to move on to deploying your agent.
