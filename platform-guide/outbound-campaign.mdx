Outbound campaigns help you reach your audience directly: to qualify leads, follow up with sign-ups, share updates, or announce offers. With superU AI, all of this happens automatically, at scale, while maintaining a natural, human-like tone.

## Set Up Your Campaign

Go to **Campaigns → Create Campaign**.

## Review and Launch

Review everything and click **Create Campaign** to launch.

Once your campaign begins, your agent will automatically start calling contacts. That's it! Your superU AI agent is now live making outbound calls.

You can track all calls in your dashboard with live status, duration, and outcomes.
