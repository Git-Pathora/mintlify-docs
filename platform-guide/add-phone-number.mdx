Phone numbers are how your superU Voice AI agents connect with real people. Once you buy a number, you can attach it to any agent for inbound or outbound campaigns.

## Why You Need a Number

Every live call made through superU AI runs through a verified phone number. Buying your own number ensures your calls look professional, helps track campaigns, and allows inbound calls to reach your agent directly. You can choose local or international numbers depending on where your customers are.

## Buy a Phone Number

Log in to your superU workspace and go to the **Phone Numbers** tab from the left menu.

Pick the area that matches your customer base. We offer phone numbers of major countries. For example, if you serve clients in the US, choose a US number for a US-based caller ID.

Once you select a number, review the details and click **Buy Number**. The number will be added to your workspace instantly.

You'll now see your purchased number listed under **Phone Numbers** with its status set to **Active**.

## Connect the Number to Your Agent

**For Outbound Calls:**

Open the **Phone Numbers** tab in your dashboard. Once purchased, assign that number to your outbound agent.

This will be the caller ID shown when your agent makes calls.

**For Inbound Calls:**

Go to the **Campaign** tab in your superU dashboard and create an inbound campaign. Select the **phone number** you've purchased and assign your inbound agent to it.

Once assigned, the campaign status will change to **Active**, and your agent will be ready to **receive live incoming calls**.

Once linked, your AI agent can start making and receiving calls instantly. It will all be visible and trackable from your superU dashboard.
