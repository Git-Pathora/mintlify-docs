# Build Your First AI Agent

Go to the [superU Dashboard.](https://workspace.superu.ai/dashboard) and sign up to your workspace.

Choose how you want to build your agent. You can start from scratch, let AI create one from your brief, or pick a ready-made template to get started quickly.

### Using Templates

If you choose to use our templates, you'll see an assorted set of templates on the next page. We have over 100+ selections of templates from various industries and use cases for you to choose. Select one which suits you.

Just click on 'Create Agent' to see your agent created on your dashboard.

After that step, your agent will be visible on your dashboard, once you click on it, you can try 'Test AI Agent' to hear your agent.

### Create with AI

If you would rather create your agent using our AI's help, then click on 'Create with AI'. Describe the kind of agent you want to build. Share what it should do, who it will talk to, and the tone you want. The assistant will turn your idea into a ready-to-edit draft.

Wait a little while for your agent to be created and you'll be able to see a fully functional agent draft ready for you to publish. Edit as per your wishes and then click on 'Publish'.

### Start from Scratch

If you choose to start from a blank agent, you'll begin by setting up the basics: pick a voice, language, and model, then describe what your agent should do. You'll also add the system prompt to define its personality and write the first message it'll say on a call.

Browse the **Voice Library** from the sidebar, filter by provider, gender, or language, and play a few samples to find one that matches your agent's tone and personality. Keep your preferred voice in mind for later since you can change it anytime from your agent settings.

# Add Knowledge Base to an Agent

The Knowledge Base is what makes your AI agent sound informed. It's where you store all the product details, FAQs, or support information your agent will use while talking to customers. Think of it as your agent's brain: without it, the agent can talk, but it won't *know* much.

## Create a New Knowledge Base

From the left sidebar, click **Knowledge Base** under the "Build" section.

![Screenshot 2025-11-08 175914](/platform-guide/images/Screenshot_2025-11-08_175914.png)

You'll see a list of all your existing Knowledge Bases. Click **Create Knowledge Base** in the top-right corner to make a new one.

Enter a **Name** for your Knowledge Base (for example, *Genus Product FAQs*).

![Screenshot 2025-11-08 174249](/platform-guide/images/Screenshot_2025-11-08_174249.png)

Add a **Description** that clearly explains what the file contains.
- Example: *This Knowledge Base includes Genus inverter and battery FAQs with product features, model details, and warranty information.*
- **You absolutely need to add an accurate description along with your PDF or CSV file without it, the Knowledge Base will not have enough context to work properly.**

Upload your file by clicking **Choose Files**.
- Supported formats: **CSV** or **PDF**
- File size limit: **10 MB**

Click **Create** once your file is uploaded and description is filled in.

![image 28](/platform-guide/images/image%2028.png)

Your Knowledge Base will now appear in the main list.

## Connect Knowledge Base to an Agent

Go to the **Agents** tab.

![695925bd-4a04-44d5-ad63-c31999eb5f2c](/platform-guide/images/695925bd-4a04-44d5-ad63-c31999eb5f2c.png)

Open the agent you want to link with this Knowledge Base. On the right panel, click **Knowledge Base**.

![image 29](/platform-guide/images/image%2029.png)

Select your new Knowledge Base and click **Save**.

![image 30](/platform-guide/images/image%2030.png)

The agent will now use that Knowledge Base to answer questions during calls and your agent will sound informed and updated.

## Review and Update Files

Click it anytime to view or replace the document. You can upload multiple files if you want to expand the same Knowledge Base later.

# Test Your Agent

Once your agent is created and published, you can now test how it performs in real time.

Click **"Test AI Agent"** at the top right of your screen. A test window will open where you can choose between **Web Call** (browser-based) or **Phone Call**.

Plug in your **headphones or mic** for a smoother experience and click **"Initiate Call"** to start testing.

Speak naturally or type your questions to check how the agent greets, responds, and follows the script.

If you spot any issues, make quick adjustments in the **System Prompt**, **First Message**, or **Knowledge Base**, then test again. Once your agent sounds polished and natural, you're ready to move on to deploying your agent.
