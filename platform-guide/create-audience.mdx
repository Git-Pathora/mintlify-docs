An audience is your contact list for outbound campaigns. It contains the customer names and phone numbers that your agent will call.

## Upload Your Audience

Head to the **Audience** tab in your superU dashboard.

## Map CSV Columns

Map your CSV columns to match the required fields (Name, Phone Number, etc.). Check if you have any validation errors.

Once everything looks correct, create the audience. Your contact list is now ready to be used in campaigns.

You can create multiple audiences for different call lists to make it easier to manage different customer segments or campaigns.
