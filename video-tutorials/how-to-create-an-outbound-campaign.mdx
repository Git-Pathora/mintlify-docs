## What the video covers

The walkthrough builds your audience step by step from the contact list, shows how to attach a phone number, and walks you through assigning the agent who will run the calls. You learn how to configure the campaign settings, start the campaign, and track how calls, connects, and outcomes are performing.

It highlights the dashboards you can use to pause, adjust scripts, or reassign numbers if performance dips.

## Expected outcome

When the video ends, you have a live campaign with a defined audience, connected phone number, assigned agent, and a performance view so you can see what to tweak next.
