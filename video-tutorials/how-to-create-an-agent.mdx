## What the video covers

The walkthrough shows how to launch the **Create with AI** assistant for a guided build, or how to browse 100+ ready-made templates and customize one to match your brand. You see how to name the agent, pick its voice, and drop in a concise system prompt that defines its tone.

After you publish, the video walks you through testing the agent using the **Test AI Agent** button so you can hear how it sounds before deploying.

## Expected outcome

You finish the tutorial with a published agent whose voice, prompt, and personality match your vision, and you know exactly which template or AI option to return to when you need a fast refresh.
