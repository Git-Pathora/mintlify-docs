## What the video covers

You see how to write the message your agent follows on every call. The host explains why simple, direct instructions keep the conversation natural and on point, then shows how to list do's and don'ts, set the call structure, and remind the agent to collect key information.

The walkthrough confirms that keeping the prompt under a few sentences makes it easier for the agent to stay consistent while allowing the conversation to flow.

## Expected outcome

You leave the tutorial with a crisp system prompt that defines the agent's role, the voice you expect, and the core flow you want it to follow, so every call feels purposeful.
