## What the video covers

The video shows how to upload a knowledge base, choose the right file type, and attach it to your agent. While you attach the file, it encourages you to add a short description so the agent understands what the document is about and can reference it correctly on calls.

You see how to check ingestion status and refresh the content when you upload a new version.

## Expected outcome

You finish with at least one knowledge base attached, a clear description of what it contains, and confidence that your agent can quickly pull facts from the new data during conversations.
