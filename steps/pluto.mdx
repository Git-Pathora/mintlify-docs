## Introduction

**Pluto** lets you build a real-time conversational AI voice assistant for your website or app. It uses your microphone to capture audio, streams it to an AI model, and plays back the AI's spoken response—all in just a few hundred milliseconds.

---

## Quick Overview

**Goal:** Enable real-time voice conversations with AI.

**Use Cases:**
- Customer support over AI calls
- Voice assistant for your website/app
- Cold calling with AI
- Call center automation

**Tech Stack:**
- Python
- PyAudio
- WebSockets
- SuperU SDK

**Input:** Microphone audio  
**Output:** AI-generated speech

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Python installed on your computer
- Internet connection
- A microphone and speakers/headphones
- An account on [SuperU](https://dev.superu.ai/)

---

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up and Get Your API Key">
    1. Go to [dev.superu.ai](https://dev.superu.ai/) and sign up for an account
    2. After signing up, visit your dashboard
    3. Copy your API key from the dashboard
    
    <Note>
      For security, store your API key in an environment variable instead of hard-coding it in your code.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Setup & Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Open your terminal and run the appropriate command for your operating system:

    ```bash
    # Windows
    pip install pyaudio websockets superu

    # macOS/Linux
    pip3 install pyaudio websockets superu
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Audio">
    The code will use your system's default microphone and speakers. No extra setup is needed, but make sure your devices are working properly.
    
    <Tip>
      Test your microphone and speakers before running the assistant to ensure optimal performance.

## Running the Demo

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy and Run the Code">
    Create a new Python file (e.g., `pluto_voice_assistant.py`) and paste the following code. Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual API key:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    import pyaudio
    import websockets
    import uuid
    import base64
    import json
    import superu

    FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16
    CHANNELS = 1
    SEND_SAMPLE_RATE = 16000
    CHUNK_SIZE = 1024
    pya = pyaudio.PyAudio()

    def get_default_input_device_index():
        for i in range(pya.get_device_count()):
            dev = pya.get_device_info_by_index(i)
            if dev['maxInputChannels'] > 0:
                print(f"Using device: {dev['name']} (Index: {i})")
                return i
        raise RuntimeError("No input device found.")

    mic_index = get_default_input_device_index()

    async def send_audio(stream, websocket, streamId):
        await websocket.send(json.dumps({"event": "start", "start": {"streamId": streamId}}))
        while True:
            audio_chunk = await asyncio.to_thread(stream.read, CHUNK_SIZE)
            payload = base64.b64encode(audio_chunk).decode('utf-8')
            await websocket.send(json.dumps({"event": "media", "media": {"payload": payload}}))

    async def receive_messages(websocket):
        output_stream = await asyncio.to_thread(
            pya.open, format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=SEND_SAMPLE_RATE, output=True)
        while True:
            try:
                response = json.loads(await websocket.recv())
                if response.get("event") == "playAudio":
                    audio_data = base64.b64decode(response["media"]["payload"])
                    await asyncio.to_thread(output_stream.write, audio_data)
            except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
                print("WebSocket connection closed.")
                break

    async def listen_and_send(uri, streamId):
        stream = await asyncio.to_thread(
            pya.open, format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=SEND_SAMPLE_RATE,
            input=True, input_device_index=mic_index, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK_SIZE)
        async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
            print("Connected to WebSocket. Streaming audio...")
            try:
                await asyncio.gather(
                    send_audio(stream, websocket, streamId),
                    receive_messages(websocket))
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error: {e}")
            finally:
                stream.stop_stream()
                stream.close()
                pya.terminate()
                print("Connection closed.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        superu_client = superu.SuperU('<YOUR_API_KEY>')
        First_message = "Hey there! Ready to explore some fascinating science today?"
        System_prompt = """
            You are a helpful and curious science assistant. Your job is to answer questions clearly, concisely, and in a way that's engaging for someone interested in science.
        """
        pluto = superu_client.pluto.create_call(
            first_message=First_message,
            system_prompt=System_prompt,
            voice_id="90ipbRoKi4CpHXvKVtl0"  # Anika - Customer Care Agent
        )
        asyncio.run(listen_and_send(pluto['ws_url'], pluto['streamId']))
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Application">
    Execute your Python file using the appropriate command:

    ```bash
    # Windows
    python pluto_voice_assistant.py

    # macOS/Linux
    python3 pluto_voice_assistant.py
    ```
    
    <Check>
      You should see "Connected to WebSocket. Streaming audio..." in your terminal, indicating a successful connection.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customizing Your Assistant

You can personalize your AI assistant by modifying several key components:

### Change the First Message

The `First_message` variable defines what the assistant says when the conversation starts.

```python
First_message = "Hello! How can I help you today?"
```

Set this to any greeting or introduction that fits your use case.

### Modify the System Prompt

The `System_prompt` variable defines how the assistant should behave and respond.

```python
System_prompt = """
You are a friendly and knowledgeable customer support assistant. 
Help users with their questions about our products and services.
"""
```

<Tip>
  Adjust this prompt to fit your specific use case, such as customer support, language learning, or technical help.
</Tip>

## How It Works

The voice assistant operates through a real-time audio streaming process:

1. **Audio Capture**: Your microphone captures your voice
2. **WebSocket Transmission**: Audio is sent to the AI model via WebSocket connection
3. **AI Processing**: The AI listens, processes, and generates a response
4. **Voice Synthesis**: The AI's response is converted to natural-sounding speech
5. **Audio Playback**: You hear the AI's response through your speakers—all in real time!

## Available Voices

You can choose from many different AI voices by changing the `voice_id` parameter. Each voice has a unique ID and supports various languages.
